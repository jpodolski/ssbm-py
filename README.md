ssbm-py is a python GUI written to help SSBM streamers manage OBS and their overlay. It is currently in beta and (will soon) feature support for
  - Stock Head Icons, Tags, and Prefixes
  - Automatic Scene Switching 
  - Webcam management

### Setting up the application

First things first, you'll need to have python3 installed. You can check if you have python3 installed by typing 
```sh
$ which python3
```
..into a terminal window. If you see something like 
```sh
$ /usr/bin/python3
```
Then it's already installed. If you don't see anything, then you need python3. You can download it from the link below:
[Download Python Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you've got python installed, simply start up the program by opening a terminal in the ssbm-py directory, and typing
```sh
python3 gui.py
```
to get started.

### Configuring with OBS

Unfortunately, even this readme is a work in progress, so you can figure it out on your own for now.
