This is an in-progress project designed to be a utility for SSBM Streamers using OBS

Project Goals:
	- Create a comprehensive but simple class for an SSBM Match
	- Develop a GUI with a system to store, record, and manipulate Match data
	- Use challonge.com's API to link challonge matches to Match objects
	- Provide a suite of misc. tools to interact with OBS though plugins/files

Development is ongoing and likely unstable. This repo is primarily for my personal use and organization

TO DO:
	- Create Match class
	- Create TKinter GUI
	- Link TKinter GUI with the Match class
	- Write file manipulation functions
	- Integrate Challonge
	- Document with Doxygen
	- Get a stable version
	- Test/debug on different systems
