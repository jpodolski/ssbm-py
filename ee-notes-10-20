sequential switching circuits have the property that the output depends not only on the present in put but also on the past seq of inputs

ineffect, these circuits must be able to remember something about the past history of the inputs


in synchronous digital systems it is ommon practice to sync the operation of all flip flops by a common clock
each of the flip flops has a clock input and the flip flops are memory devices that can only change output in response to a clock input, not data inputs
a memory element that has no clock it is called a latch

feedback
	by feedback we mean that the output of 

	the outputs depen only on the state of the inputs all of the times. any change in the state of one of the inputs will ripple though the circuit immediately

	examples of combo logic are nand and nor gates, inverters, and buffers

seq logic
	has memory

most flip flops are clocked

bistable circuit
